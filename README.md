## Overview

This two-day workshop introduces the essential concepts of building deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras via R. Throughout this workshop you will gain an intuitive understanding of the architectures and engines that make up deep learning models, apply a variety of deep learning algorithms (i.e. MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, collaborative filtering), understand when and how to tune the various hyperparameters, and be able to interpret model results. You will have the opportunity to apply practical applications covering a variety of tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, product recommendation and more. Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of deep learning and be able to implement a systematic approach for producing high quality modeling results.

## Is this course for me?

Is this workshop for you? If you answer "yes" to these three questions, then this workshop is likely a good fit: 

1. Are you relatively new to the field of deep learning and neural networks but eager to learn? Or maybe you have applied a basic feedforward neural network but aren‚Äôt familiar with the other deep learning frameworks? 

2. Are you an experienced R user comfortable with the tidyverse, creating functions, and applying control (i.e. if, ifelse) and iteration (i.e. for, while) statements? 

3. Are you familiar with the machine learning process such as data splitting, feature engineering, resampling procedures (i.e. k-fold cross validation), hyperparameter tuning, and model validation? 

This workshop will provide some review of these topics but coming in with some exposure will help you stay focused on the deep learning details rather than the general modeling procedure details.

## Prework

I make a few assumptions of your established knowledge regarding your programming skills and machine learning familiarity (items #2-3 in the previous section). Below are my assumptions and some resources to read through to make sure you are properly prepared.

| Assumptions                       | Resource      
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| You should be familiar with the Tidyverse, control flow, and writing functions | [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) | 
| You should be familiar with the basic concept of machine learning | [Ch. 1 HOMLR](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/intro.html) | 
| You should be familiar with the machine learning modeling process | [Ch. 2 HOMLR](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html) | 
| You should be familiar with the feature engineering process | [Ch. 3 HOMLR](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/engineering.html) |


You will require several packages and datasets throughout this workshop. If you are attending the workshop these will be preinstalled for you so you do not need to worry about your OS differing from mine. However, after you leave the workshop, the first notebook below will allow you to reproduce the work you did in the workshop. Also, at the conference workshop, we will all use the RStudio Cloud platform. The second notebook below will get you set up so that we can hit the ground running on day 1!

## Schedule

This workshop is notebook-focused. Consequently, most of our time will be spent
in R notebooks; however, I will also jump to slides to explain certain concepts
in further detail. Throughout the notebooks, you will see ‚ÑπÔ∏è icons that will
hyperlink to relevant slides (or additional reading).
